					<div class="sectionContent">
					<div class="subCategory">
						<p>OilGo is a mobile oil change service created at UCSD’s 10-week startup competition. In 10 weeks, eleven teams competed to create a novel business that would facilitate interpersonal interaction via technology. The competition was judged by local industry professionals, and my team took first place.</p>
						<p>We utilized the user-centered design process, emphasizing on iteration to discover unmet user needs, thus leading to potential business concepts.</p>
						<p>I worked on user research and concept development.  I learned fundamental skills required to develop a business, with a focus on the aspects regarding human-computer interaction.</p>

					    <div class="sectionContent">
						<h4 class="subHeader">Ideation</h4>
						<div class="subCategory">
							<p>We began ideating because we were unsure of what we wanted the topic of our project to be. For some inspiration, we created a chart analyzing the current political, economic, social, and technological state of the world. We discussed relevant news, emerging technologies, and popular trends that we could capitalize on for our business.</p>
							<div class="centerImage rightImage">
								<img id="Pest" alt="Pest Chart" src="images/Pest1.png">
								<figcaption>P.E.S.T. chart used to analyze the state of the world</figcaption>
							</div>
							<p>Independently we created at least 10 ideas based on our previous analysis. In total, we had 57 potential business ideas such as a VR rental service, a cat care service, and a national survey platform. As a team we evaluated all of our ideas based on novelty, desirability, and viability. In the end, we believed that the idea with the most potential was a service that connected lesser-known content creators with sponsors. </p>
						</div>
					</div>
						<div class="sectionContent">
							<h4 class="subHeader">Research</h4>
							<div class="subCategory">
								<p>Our next step was to research if our idea of connecting lesser-known content creators and sponsors was in fact novel, viable, and desirable. I helped create a competitive analysis matrix of competitors. Factors of the matrix were based on the success and shortcomings of each business. We quickly learned that there was no novelty in this idea. A lot of companies have already capitalized on content creators’ need of sponsors. Instead of restarting, I suggested we change our users from content creators to organizations.</p>
								<div class="centerImage">
									<img id="Matrix" alt="Matrix" src="images/CompetitiveAnalysisMatrix.png">
									<figcaption>SponsorUp buissness flow. </figcaption>
								</div>
								<p>I created the value flow diagram for our sponsorship idea to reflect the change of user. I defined organizations to be school clubs, youth teams, recreational clubs, and nonprofits. We named our platform SponsorUp. Companies and organizations would be able to connect with each other using our platform. Our revenue would come from a service fee taken after the two parties reached an agreement.</p>

						<div class="sectionContent">
							<h4 class="subHeader">Failure and Iteration</h4>
							<div class="subCategory">
								<p> Unfortunately for my team, connecting users to sponsors via an app was not considered novel. The competition's director highly suggested we come up with a new idea.</p>
								<p> Instead of scrapping three weeks of work, I suggested that we take what we learned from researching sponsorships and apply it to a new type of user-to-user interaction. The only question next was, which type of user-to-user interaction?  By redefining our focus to be the business’ user interactions rather than the entire business, I saved the team a lot of time. </p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="sectionContent">
							<h4 class="subHeader">Ideating & Storyboarding</h4>
							<div class="subCategory ">
								<p> As a team, we ideated on what types of user to user interactions we wanted to pursue. For inspiration we listed common interactions neighboors share with one another. I chose to draw inspiration from the neighboor to neighboor relationship because its interactions are based upon proximity, interests, and compassion; all of which are fundamental to every interactions we sough to improve.</p>
								<p>After we generated a substantial list of interactions, we created storyboards to illustrate how might the interactions be facilitated between strangers and improved through a through a technological solution. In each storyboard the primary user had a unique problem that required in person assistance. Their problem was solved by using an app that facilitated an interaction with another local user. </p>
								<div class="centerImage">
									<img class="StoryBoard" alt="StoryBoard" src="images/sb1.png" >
									<figcaption> This storyboard demonstrates a user needing to rent a tool from a local.</figcaption>
								</div>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="sectionContent">
							<h4 class="subHeader">Interviews & Research</h4>
							<div class="subCategory">
								<p>Our research started with conducting 48 in-person interviews. To learn what interaction was viable we presented subjects with our storyboards. After a subject viewed every storyboard asked him or her to rate the interaction on a scale of 1-10 for each category: relevance, relatability, and likeliness of use. </p>
								<div class="centerImage">
									<img class="StoryBoard" alt="storyboard" src="images/KnittingStoryboard.png">
									<figcaption>Our highest rated scenario, finding a mentor for a specialized task. </figcaption>
								</div>
								<p>The highest rated scenario was finding a mentor to knit. Interview subjects related to the need of finding someone for help on a specialized task. We focused on this scenario and the story it told: users picking up or practicing hobbies, and wanting to improve, but having nobody to help them when they encounter a problem.</p>
								<p> After solidifying that this was the user-to-user interaction that we wanted to pursue, we conducted competitive analysis on existing services in the field. Our most important findings were:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										Users rely on specialized forums or Reddit for guidance, which are more geared towards information exchange, rather than in-person mentorship and collaboration.
									</li>
									<li>
										Mentee/mentor relationships are forged through familial or professional relationships -there is a lack of options when connecting with local people outside your network who share the same hobbies.
									</li>
									<li>
										There doesn’t yet exist a service completely dedicated to local mentee-mentor interactions for specialzied tasks or hobbies
									</li>
									<li>
										Social media groups such as Facebook or MeetUp groups are not tailored for one on one interactions.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="sectionContent">
							<h4 class="subHeader">Development and Failure</h4>
							<div class="subCategory">
								<p>With this new direction in mind, we developed a platform to connect novices to experts across fields. Our goal was to provide users with local, in-person connections.</p>
								<div class="rightImage" >
									<img id="DIYMentorship" alt="DIY value flow" src="images/DIY (1).png">
									<figcaption>Our value flow for our mentorship platform called DIY. Our revenue was based on advertisments.</figcaption>
								</div>
								<p> I developed value flow for the buisness and there after I realized our largest fault. Our sucess relied on the assumption that we would have a large user base. As such charging users to interact with eachother would act as a deterent for users. Moreover I assumed users would not pay for our platform when free services such as facebook groups could facilitate local interactions that could evolve into a mentorship. For revenue we were forced to rely on advertisements and selling user data. To make things worse we had no strategy for retaining users after they interacted with another user. Once the two meet, they could exchange contact information and never use the app again. For these reasons we decided to forefeit this idea. </p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="sectionContent">
							<h4 class="subHeader">The Pivot</h4>
							<div class="subCategory">
								<p>At this point, we had only one week left to deliver a novel startup, and again, we’d returned to ideation. This time around, we had extensive research validating the premise of forging in-person connections between novices and experts in any given field. </p>
								<p>I realized that the issue with our previous concept was its broad scope. To narrow the scope of genre of interactions I introduced a topic I am very familiar with, car restoration. My idea was to  connect novice car enthusiasts with local experts because it requires in-person interaction. While considering the value flow for this interaction I realized that we did not have to limit ourselves to car restorations. Instead, we could connect expert car mechanics to people who need car services from an expert. By narrowing our scope of our interactions to car services, I invented the idea of OilGo, but was it a viable, desirable, or novel? Almost out of time, we rushed to find out! </p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="sectionContent">
							<h4 class="subHeader">Research & Testing</h4>
							<div class="subCategory">
								<p>We conducted another competitive analysis, and found that there was only one other company called Wrench with the same idea. Wrench was based in LA and they charged for an annual subscription. Other mobile oil change services existed in the San Diego area but they only catered to fleet vehicles. It seemed that by adding some slight variation to our service it would be a novel service to the San Diego area.</p>
								<p>To test the desirability of the idea I conducted service enactments. I advertised on Facebook’s marketplace, offering free oil changes in exchange for a post-service interview. Customers had to pay for the oil, but my services were free. To my team’s excitement, the post received a lot of attention.</p>
								<div class="rightImage">
									<img id="ServicePost" alt="Service Post" src="images/ServicePost.JPG" >
									<figcaption> Post I made for the service enactments. In total I recieved 36 requests. </figcaption>
								</div>
								<p>In total, I complete eight service enactments and interviews. My team drove me to each customer’s location and I’d act like a professional mechanic. I didn’t have a uniform, but dressed as close to one as I could. No two services were alike, as I acted upon the feedback I received from those previous. By the last enactment, I was offering vacuuming services, fluid refills, and vehicle inspections.</p>

									With one day left in the competition, Jennifer and Danny created mobile wireframes while I directed and edited our pitch video. Jennifer also did amazing work on our branding and Marlo put everything together on our final poster. I created the budget for the business. Under the assumption that our advertisements maintained an impression rate of 1% with 3% join rate, I predicted that the business would become profitable within 11 months! Our idea was financially viable! </p>

					<h2 class="projectsHeader"> Reflection</h2>
					<div class="sectionContent">
						<div class="subCategory">
							<p>Startups are hard. Our countless pivots caused a massive loss of time. In truth we created OilGo in a week and a half. Under the pressure of time I learned the value of having an amazing team. No one attatched their ego to the startup, and everyone was open to pivotting when need be. I learned how to edit videos the day before our video was due. Jennifer made our poster the day of the competition. Danny and Marlo made wireframed a prototype of the platform the day of. We were the A team, and it felt amazing winning first place.</p>
