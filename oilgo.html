		<h2 class="projectsHeader">Create a Novel Startup</h2>
		<div class="contentTextDiv">
			<p> This project was done in UCSD's startup studio instructed by Dr. Steven Dow. The studio teaches fundamental skills to develop a buisness based on human computer interactions. The studio emphasizes leveraging the shared economy to create a novel buisness. </p>
			<p>Part of the studio is a design competition. To compete teams must create a novel buisness that facilitates human to human interaction via technology in 10 weeks. At the end of 10 weeks Dow invites industry profesionals to judge each team's work. At the competition my team took first place. </p>

	<h2 class="projectsHeader"> Challenges </h2>
	<div class="contentContainer subCategory">
		<h5 class="subHeader">Novelty</h5>
		<div class="contentTextDiv">
			<p>The hardest challenge of this project was inventing novelty. To create a viable buisness there must be a prominent unmet need, and to create a new buisness you must discover a new unmet need. Every large industry has resolved prominent unmet needs, so finding a new one required intense research. Our team also never designated a topic, so we did not have a designated field to research. Instead our inital driving question was, "What do people need in the world need right now?"</p>
			<p> This question lead us to our first idea, a national survey platform. This idea was a failure because it lacked a viable buisness model. Our failure made us realize that to invent novelty we should not ask what people need, but instead, "What needs to be improved?" This change of mindset helped us disover oppertunity. Our second idea was to improve how content creators connect with advertisers. This idea failed because it lacked user retention, however I realized that we should focus on improving how users connect with eachother Our next idea aimed at improving the interactions between hobby experts and novices. This idea failed, but we iterated it to be a service that connects expert car enthusiast with novice car enthusiasts. this idea failed as well, however it lead us to our golden goose. With more iteration we developed this idea into a novel buisness concept that connects expert car mechanics with car owners. </p>
			
			<p>It took us 4 pivots and 7 weeks before we overcame the challenge of inventing novelty. We overcame this challenge by iterating on the concept of improving human to human interactions. Traditionally UX designers are taught to always begin with research, but for this project we benefitted from starting with iteration.</p>

	<h2 class="projectsHeader"> The Process </h2>
	<div class="contentContainer">
	<div class="subCategory">
			<h4 class="subHeader">Research</h4>
			<div class="contentTextDiv ">
				<p>Innovating a novel service is impossible to do out of thin air. To begin we created a chart to research the political, econmical, social, and technological state of the world.</p>
				<div class="centerImage rightImage">
					<img id="Pest" alt="Pest Chart" src="images/Pest1.png" >
				</div>
				<p>This P.E.S.T. chart helped us decide what topics we should consider. Our team decided to that there was ample oppertunity in improving technology in politics. We researched issues in the field and discovered that echo chambers and false news posts were huge issue.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
	<div class="subCategory">
			<h4 class="subHeader">Ideation</h4>
			<div class="contentTextDiv">

				<img id="NationalSafe" alt="National Saftey Service" src="images/ns1.png">
			</div>
				<p>Our team wanted to find a way to eliminate the harmful affects of social media in politics. We generated 64 possible ideas for a buisness. Our best idea was an unbiased national survey platform. It idea failed because it lacked a viable buisness model. Funding relied on government grants and advertising. Instead of continuing to create more solutions, changed the problem space. There is a lot of oppuertunity to create solutions, but not a lot of oppertunity to make money.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
	<div class="subCategory">
		<h4 class="subHeader">Failure and Iteration</h4>
			<div class="contentTextDiv ">
				<p> After our first idea we continously failed to develop a viable buisness. Each failure required us to restart our process: research, competitive analysis, ideation, and development. Our second idea was sponsor up. Through research we learned that small content creators lacked a platform to connect with advertisers. Sponsor-Up failed because after we connected content creators with advertisers we had no way of retaining either party. Despite failing I learned that we should not focus on what the buisness is rather what the buisness can improve. Sponsor-Up focused on improving the way two parties connect to conduct buisness. I changed my team's focus be that of learning what human to human interactions we can improve.</p>

	<div class="subCategory">
			<h4 class="subHeader">Interviews and Storyboarding</h4>
			<div class="contentTextDiv">
				<p>I conducted interviews so we could learn what scenarios were most relatable. In each interview I presented subjects with a storyboard. Every storyboard had a scenario where an individual uses an app to connect with another person. Each connection was unique in its purpose: tool rental, mentorship, storage rental, general help. Once the subject read through each storyboard I asked them to rate on a scale of 1-10 the likelyhood of the scenario happening to them. Out of 46 interviews the highest rated scenario was finding a mentor.</p>
				<div class="centerImage">
					<img id="StoryBoard" alt="StoryBoard" src="images/sb1.png" >

			</div>
	</div>			
	<div class="subCategory">
			<h4 class="subHeader">Failure and Iteration</h4>
			<div class="contentTextDiv">
				<p> Our next step was to develop a platform that connects users who are in need of a mentor. We created DIY, however we could not create a profitable buisness model. Our main competitors were free online forums where people  connect over shared interests. Forums are not location based and do not facilitate in person meetings like our platform would. Still, we were not confident that people would pay for this service. We could not create a profitale buissness model outside of this advertising for this project, so we iterated it. </p>

				<img id="DIYMentorship" alt="DIY value flow" src="images/DIY (1).png">
					<figcaption>Our value flow for DIY. Our revenue was based on advertisments.</figcaption>
				</div>
				<p>Instead of scrapping our idea, I iterated it to be service go. I knew people wanted experts on demand from interviews. The problem with DIY was that it was too broad of a platform. I propsed to narrow our focus to car restoration and our service would be to connect novice car enthusiasts with experts. After some though I changed it to be a service that simply connects you to a car expert for repairs. Thus OilGo was born.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
	<div class="subCategory">
			<h4 class="subHeader">Service Enactments</h4>
			<div class="contentTextDiv">
				<p>I conducted service enactments to test if OilGo was a viable service. I posted on a Facebook marketplace that I was offering a free oil changes in exchange for a post-service interview. After each service I iterated the service.</p> 				<div class="rightImage">
					<img id="ServicePost" alt="Service Post" src="images/ServicePost.JPG" >
					<figcaption> Post I made for the service enactments. In total I recieved 36 requests. </figcaption>
			</div>
				<p>The first service was simple. I meet the customer at his vehicle, completed the oil change and interview. By the third service I had almost no interaction with the customer and conducted the interview the next day. I learned that the customers enjoyed not having to do anything with their vehicle besides handing over the keys. I finally discovered an unmet need for our buisness, hastle free car maintenace. With our user-need defined and service enactments validating the buisness, OilGo was a success.</p>

		<div class="contentTextDiv">
			<p>Startups are hard. Our countless pivots caused a massive loss of time. In truth we created OilGo in a week and a half. Under the pressure of time I learned the value of having an amazing team. No one attatched their ego to the startup, and everyone was open to pivotting when need be. I learned how to edit videos the day before our video was due. Jennifer made our poster the day of the competition. Danny and Marlo made wireframed a prototype of the platform the day of. We were the A team, and it felt amazing winning first place.</p>
