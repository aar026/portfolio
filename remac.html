	<h5>Project Background</h5>
		<h2 class="projectsHeader">UCSD Athletics</h2>
	<div class="sectionContent">
			<p>Starting in 2020, UCSD will enter NCAA Division 1. This transition requires extensive funding and renovation to RIMAC, the sporting facility on campus. This development has prompted much controversy; traditionally, UCSD is recognized more for its academics rather than its athletics. Current attendance at athletic events is devastatingly low, at approximately only 120 attendants. UCSD’s population boasts over 35,000 students. </p>
			<p>So why aren’t the students attending games? And where are they if not at sporting events? This project sought to answer these questions using human-centered design to provide a solution to increase athletic event attendance. </p>

	</div>
</div>
	<div class="section Problem">
	<h2 class="projectsHeader"> The Problem </h2>
	<div class="sectionContent">
			<p>Athletics are not embedded within UCSD’s culture causing attendance at sporting events to be low. Our solution takes advantage of UCSD’s social complexity to increase attendance at such events for the university's athletic department. The big design challenge was designing a solution that worked with the longstanding culture instead of against it.</p>
			<p>We utilized the human-centered design process to discover the cause and transitioned into iterative prototyping to increase desirability and feesability.</p>
			<p>My role was to evaluate progression and manage project projection. I worked heavily on user research and data analysis during development.</p>

		<div class="subCategory">
			<h6>Stakeholders</h6>
			<p>Our first step was to define our stakeholders. Taking a holistic approach we listed all groups who would be affected by our work.</p>
			<ul style="float: left">
				<li>
					City of San Diego
				</li>
				<li>
					Athletes
				</li>
				<li>
					Faculty

				</li>
				<li>
					Students
				</li>
				<li>
					Sponsors
				</li>
				<li>
					Prospective students
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="subCategory">
			<h6>Interviews</h6>
			<p>Our next step was to interview our stakeholders to pinpoint the cause of low attendance. I interviewed four athletic directors, six prospective students, and 43 current students. Interview questions pertained to UCSD culture, desirability of campus events, and campus activities. The questions were left open-ended so participants could elaborate on what they personally had issues with, and what they wanted to see change.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="subCategory">
			<h6>Field Observations</h6>
			<p>During my interviews with UCSD Athletic's marketing director I learned that physical advertising was ineffective on campus. To understand why physical advertising was ineffective I directed my team to conduct field observations. Every team member including myself observed different advertising centers at high traffic areas for one hour. </p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="sectionContent">
		<h3 class="subHeader">Analysis</h3>
		<div class="subCategory">
			<p>To consolidate our data, we compiled our interview notes, highlighting key quotes and common themes. After discussing the interviews together as a team, we wrote key findings on post-its and grouped them by common themes and relationships into an affinity diagram. </p>

	<div class="sectionContent">
		<h3 class="subHeader">Insights</h3>
		<div class="subCategory">
			<h6>Lack of Physical Advertising Platforms </h6>
			<p> From interviews we learned that students and staff do not use physical advertising for their events. Our field observations gave us more insight as to why. We learned UCSD’s physical platforms are unregulated, unmanaged, and attractive. Flyers are often outdated or covering other flyers. There is a need to improve these platforms for all campus events.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="subCategory">
			<h6>Systematic Division by UCSD</h6>
			<p>The university’s six-college system divides the students randomly, without regard towards major, and disperses them throughout the large campus. This systematic division makes it difficult  to form a unified, cohesive community.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="subCategory">
			<h6>Lack of Campus Community</h6>
			<p>Furthermore, students feel a lack of community towards the university itself. In the entire school year, there are only two events that welcome the student body as a whole. Both events are held in the very beginning of the year, making first year students feel disillusioned for the rest of the year.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="subCategory">
			<h6>Large Population</h6>
			<p>“Campus is so large it is paralyzing to students,” remarked Nick Feller, Associate Athletic Director. His words are echoed by the students. There are over 500 student organizations spread throughout the campups, and finding the right one takes a lot of time and effort. Many students cannot accept this affordance while juggling work and school</p>
		</div>
		<div class="subCategory">
			<h6>Org Culture</h6>
			<p> When we asked students where they made friends, every one of them mentioned a non-academic student org. UCSD isn’t “socially dead” - but students overwhelmingly leave campus for socializing. They create their own social niches based on interests, separating their friends from their academic career.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="sectionContent">
		<h3 class="subHeader">Synthesis</h3>
		<p> To develop a deeper connection and understanding with our stakeholders we created models inspired by our research.</p>
		<div class="subCategory">
			<h6>Personas</h6>
			<p> Each member of our team made one user persona to reflect our stakeholders, to accurately represent the wants and needs of our users. We developed this from data gathered during interviews.</p>
			<div class="row">

			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="subCategory">
			<h6 class="subHeader"> Action Model</h6>
			<p> Based on interview data, our team created an action model to represent the action and efforts taken when a student wants to attend an event. Laying out our data this way allowed us to experience the decision-making process of our student stakeholders.</p>

	<div class="sectionContent">
		<h4 class="subHeader"> Ideation, Prototyping, and Iteration</h4>
			<div class="subCategory">
			<h6>Ideation</h6>
			<p>With our insights established, each member of the team brainstormed 10 possible solutions for our problem space. We then discussed them as a team. After weighing the pros and cons of each we decided to move ahead with physical advertisements around campus. There was an obvious need for them during research. We assumed digital billboards would boost campus pride and morale, as well as increase attendance at sporting events. To test this hypothesis, we moved on to prototyping. </p>
			<h6>Prototype 1</h6>
			<p> I used photoshop to create prototypes of the digital billboards. I took a picture of a high traffic area on campus. I then edited in a photo of a digital billboard into the picture.  </p>
			<div class="centerImage">
				<img id="BillboardPrototype" alt="Billboard Protype" src="images/display2.jpg">
				<figcaption>Prototype one.</figcaption>
			</div>
			<h6>Testing</h6>
			<p>To test this concept we presented it to two ofour primary stakeholders,  athletic directors Nick Feller and Wendy Taylor. Both liked the concept of the idea however there was no money in their budget to make digital billboards. So we scrapped this idea.</p>
			<div class="centerImage">
				<img id="NickMeet" alt="Meeting" src="images/NickMeeting.JPG">
			</div>
			<div class="subCategory">

			<h6>Evaluation and Ideation</h6>
			<p>We evaluated our previous idea to understand why it failed. Main reason being its price. Once more we ideated. This time we forced ourselves to think of something feasible and affordable. We created an incentive program for organizations. We knew the athletic department could execute. This solution also leveraged UCSD's unique social structure to increase attendance.</p>
			<h6>Prototype 2</h6>
			<p>For the second prototype, I used Adobe Illustrator to create a pamphlet. It featured information about the upcoming athletic event, as well as incentives for students should they attend, such as free gear, performing in halftime shows, and student discounts. It also appealed to student orgs to coordinate activities in conjunction with sporting events, to draw in a larger, more diverse crowd</p>
			<div class="row">

					<img class="pamphlet1 img-responsive" src="images/pamphletfront.jpg" alt="Pamphlet Outside">
				</div>
			</div>
			<h6>Testing</h6>
			<p>To test this prototype I presented it to 15 executive organization members. After the user read through the pamphlet I received their feedback. Eleven out of fifteen students said they would invite their org to an athletic event. When we presented the prototype to the athletic directors, they loved the idea but noted how this prototype focused solely on student attendance. Overall we recieved positive feedback.</p>

					<img class="pamphlet1Testing img-responsive" src="images/UserTestPamphlet1.png" alt="User Testing">
				</div>
			</div>
			<h6>Iteration</h6>
			<p>Although our second prototype was well-received, we iterated on it to reflect received feedback. To better visualize the needs of our users I created an affinity diagram identifying three main factors that would improve attendance. Firstly for our org incentive program to be successful, it had to be advertised. Secondly desirable incentives would increase attendance. Lastly, orgs wanted self-promotion. Organization leaders said they would take advantage of out incentive program if it the athletic department gave them recognition at the event. With all of this in mind, we returned to prototyping.</p>

				<img id="Afinnity2" alt="Pamphlet Inside" class="img-responsive" src="images/AffinityRemac2.png">
			</div>
			</div>
			<div class="subCategory">
			<h6>Final Design</h6>
			<p> Our final design eliminated wordage that restricted the incentive program to students, allowing us to welcome all of our stakeholders to any athletic event. We also increased desirability of our program by adding incentives students asked for. </p>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-6 thumb">
					<img id="FinalInside" alt="Pamphlet Inside" class="img-responsive" src="images/FinalPamphletInside.png">

					<img id="FinalOutside" class="img-responsive" src="images/FinalPamphletOutside.png" alt="Pamphlet Outside">
				</div>
			</div>
			</div>
			<h6>Implementation</h6>
			<p>The objective of this project was to design a solution for the University of California San Diego. We gave our work to the athletic department at UCSD, however we did not have to implement our solution. There was substantial evidence that our solution would increase attendance. Hopefully the department will implement it in the comming years. </p>

	<h2 class="projectsHeader"> Reflection</h2>
	<div class="sectionContent">
		<div class="contentTextDiv">
			<p> This was my first project where I experienced such back-and-forth between research and iteration, and the level of improvement each round brings. I’ve come to realize that there isn’t a limit to new data and insights, and the potential of each iteration. Your entire design concept could change, putting you back on square one - or, it could all just result in a subtle improvement to your project. I learned to truly embrace the never-ending cycle that is the human-centered design process with this project, comfortable with the knowledge that a ‘perfect design’ doesn’t exist. </p>
