						<p> All car companies wants to be at the forefront of innovation, and right now self-driving cars is what's hot. Hyundai asked The Design Lab at UCSD to produce a cool autonomous vehicle with awesome in-transit amenities and features that people will love. Don Norman, the director of The Design Lab and father of design, told Hyundai something along the lines of, </p>
						<p style="font-style:italic">"No, we won't do that. You don't know what you want. Instead, we will tell you what makes a 'good' self-driving." </p>

						<p> If you are only here for the final product, here it is. Drum roll please. The final product was a framework describing critical interdependent factors that affect the autonomous vehicle experience. By using our framework Hyundai will be capable of understanding how users engage with autonomous transit. More importantly they will be ahead of their competition. Due to the non disclosure agreement I signed I am unable to share the critical factors, but am able to describe the process that led us to them. </p>

				<h2 class="projectsHeader"> Challenges </h2>
				<div class="contentContainer subCategory">
					<h5 class="subHeader">Project Focus</h5>
					<div class="contentTextDiv">
						<p>After brainstorming my team continued to create hundreds of wonderful ideas. I acknowledged every idea, however they began to disrupt the focus of the project. The undergraduates competed for recognition from the admin team. Moreover most of the ideas were not based on data. As a lead I supported everyones' creativity however it began to interfere with the development of a final product. </p>
						<p>To fix the problem before it got out of control I called for a meeting with my undergraduate team. Together we discussed the trajectory of the project and what exactly they wanted to make. As expected everyone said something along the lines of  wanting to make an amazing A.V. I then explained to them that amazing products are created from amazing ideas. Next question, "What makes an amazing idea?" Without allowing them to answer I explained that amazing ideas are founded on insights derived from amazing data.</p>
						<div class="centerImage">
							<img id="CarTree" alt="Tree Car" src="images/CarTree.png">
						</div>
						<p> I concluded the meeting with this image. I used the analogy of a tree to describe our process. The roots, or insights, was the foundation to our tree. Like roots, our insights were constantly searching for new nutrients, or data, for growth. Together the roots support the trunk, or base product. Then the base product may branch out and grow into a totally different product. However, that different product would be validated through research and data. "Many of you are trying to grow a tree out of the sky!" I exclaimed. My team understood, and was excited to begin developing our trunk. I reassured them that no matter what work they produced, they were chosen to work on this project because they are awesome.</p>
					</div>
					<h5 class="subHeader">Lack of data</h5>
					<div class="contentTextDiv">
						<p>Another challenge our team faced was an absence of data. We did not know what people really do in autonomous vehicles. Do they pick their nose? Splay themselves comfortably like a thanksgiving turkey? Although we conducted interviews realistic behavioral data was inacessible because A.V.s do not exist for consumers! By redefining what an autonomous vehicle is, I resolved this challenge. Our team was understanding an autonomous vehicle to be a machine that transports the user to a location without constant input from the user. This is a valid definition, but it limited what we could observe for data.</p>
						<div class="rightImage">
							<img id="MenInAV" alt="Car Tree" src="images/TwoMenInAv.gif">
							<figcaption>What is an autonomous vehicle? Under our new definition, this is!</figcaption>
						</div>
						<p>My new definition of an A.V. is simple but unconventional. Space, or distance, is how far your destination is. Time is how long it takes to get somewhere. Improving transportation is the attempt to master the relationship of space and time. But if you are in an A.V. paying no attention to your surrondings, does the space you traversed matter at all? Full automation will result in user apathy towards the outside world. As such how different is an autonomous vehicle from a doctor's waiting room? In a waiting room you are traveling forwards through time to your appointment. If you did not pay attention to the outside world while driving, aren't you simply in a waiting room too?  My new definition of an autonomous vehicle is: Any space that requires limited input from the user. Under such definition we allowed ourselves to observe people in waiting rooms, busses, and trains. Jodi Lam and I collected 12 hours of video data of raw human behavior in autonomous spaces. </p>

				<div class="contentContainer">
					<div class="subCategory">
						<h4 class="subHeader">Ideation</h4>
						<div class="contentTextDiv ">
							<p>To begin our quest of discovery I led ideation sessions with the undergraduate team. I love starting a project with ideation sessions because gives everyone an opportunity to voice their ideas before the projects takes any direction. Plus it is a wonderful way to break the ice.</p>
							<div class="centerImage rightImage">
								<img id="IdeationSession" alt="Ideation in Session" src="images/IdeationSession.jpg" >
								<figcaption> Ideation in session.</figcaption>
							</div>
							<p>The objective of the ideation session was to identify ideas and concerns we should research. Each group took two minutes to independently write their ideas onto post-its. After I  led each group through a discussion of their ideas. To conclude the session we compiled all of our ideas onto a whiteboard and grouped them by emerging relationships.</p>
							<p> Overall the students exposed topics we had not yet considered; women safety, boarding procedures, medical emergencies, crime. All topics that will greatly influence a user's experience inside of an autonomous vehicle.  I debriefed the admin on our ideation session, informing them of all the topics we did not consider when drafting the project's trajectory.</p>
							<div class="centerImage">
								<img id="AffinityDiagram" alt="Affinity Diagram" src="images/AffinityHyundai.JPG">
								<figcaption>I translated our ideation session into an affinity diagram. Communication was our largest group. </figcaption>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="subCategory">
						<h4 class="subHeader">Research</h4>
						<div class="contentTextDiv">
							<p> Through ideation I was able to identify what issues my teammates cared about. Some were passionate about women saftey, others interface control. Moving forward I used their passion towards an issue to create small teams. I tasked each group with researching an issue of their chosing, expanding upon current solutions and influencing factors. As I expected each team's topic was the issue I founded their group on.</p>
							<div class="centerImage">
								<img id="JapaneseTrain" alt="Japanese Train Car" src="images/WomenCar.jpg" >
								<figcaption>Most of Japan's trains have a women only car to make women feel comfortable traveling.</figcaption>
							</div>
							<p>After two tweeks of research our team found that the automation industry has attempted to resolve concerns we had. However the solutions are not ideal for autonomous vehicles. For example to improve womens' saftey Japan has women only train cars. While women only autonomous taxis are feasible, there would be no procture to ensure all passengers are female. An imposter can easily create a fake account and claim to be a woman. Although discovered solutions such as this one weren't always ideal, I made sure to keep them in the data. With a little iteration any solution can become THE resolution </p>
							<p> Our team also conducted field research to understand how users interact with current mobility solutions. I stationed students at high traffic areas during peak hours at UCSD. Each student recorded popular modes of transport, stuff people carried, and activites they witnessed. The student team also conducted in-transit observations during their trips back home for winter break. In total we completed 96 hours of field research.</p>

						<h4 class="subHeader">Data Analysis</h4>
						<div class="contentTextDiv leftText">
							<p>After all of our research I analyzed the data with my partner Christine Tran. Researching specific issues gave us information on what is being done, what has been done, and what can be done to resolve an issue. Field observations provided insight into how people are currently managing and using current modes of transportation. After hours of grouping, sorting, and annotating this information Christine and I developed key insights into our problem space. We felt confident that our team knew enough to begin innovating forward.</p>

						<h4 class="subHeader">Brainstorm and Speculation</h4>
						<div class="contentTextDiv rightText">
							<p> After sharing our findings with the entire team Christine and I led the student team through brainstorm sessions. With the data our team began to  design solutions for the boarding process, vehicle cleaning, passenger saftey, communication, interface controll, and much more. As per Hyundai's request we also thought of fun novel things people could do inside the A.V. Christine and I facilitated brainstorm sessions through small group activites. In their groups students were asked to draw and act out their ideas. We concluded every session with a group disscussion. This stage of the process took three weeks. I decided to move forward once we had created a possible solution to every design issue we discovered during research. Now it was time to create them.</p>

						<h4 class="subHeader">Communicating with our Partner</h4>
						<div class="contentTextDiv">
							<p> At this point in the project I started delivering weekly progress updates with Colleen Emmenegger to Hyundai Motor Company of South Korea. I compiled our information and transformed it into comprehendable mediums for Hyundai. I also validated the personas, designs, and scenarios we presented to Hyundai.</p>

						<div class="contentTextDiv">
							<div class="leftImage" >
								<img id="AdrianBrandon"  alt="Prototyping in action" src="images/PrototypeCreation.jpg">
							</div>
							<p>After the admin team decided what the team should test, I lead the creation of the first prototype. Because this was a preliminary project with Hyundai, we only had enough resources for one iteration of our prototype. As such our team attempted to maximize our findings by including almost all of our design decisions. The final prototype was an 8 foot by 6 foot box made to look like a car. Inside we added in transit ammenities, chairs, and storage units.</p>

								<figcaption>A sketch of the interior of the prototype by April Gau</figcaption>

							<p>I constructed the frame for the prototype with the help of Brandon Nyguen. For our interface I divided my undergraduate team into 3 teams and delegated wireframing responsibilities to each team. Once all team finished I combined their work into a functional interface for our prototype.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="subCategory">
						<h4 class="subHeader">User Testing</h4>
						<div class="contentTextDiv">
							<p>This was the last step of our process. We conducted 4 user tests with our prototype. In each scenario we had two users enter the 'vehicle' with their belongings. They were then welcomed by the A.I. of the car. A HUD showed their current position and the length of their trip. A responsive menu explained the voice commands they could use to access the ammenities of the vehicle. </p>
							<div class="rightImage">
								<img id="WizardofOZ" alt="wizard of Oz" src="images/WizardofOz.jpg">
								<figcaption>Me being the Wizard of the Oz</figcaption>
							</div>
							<p>In truth I was the A.I. We wizard of oz'd the user's experience. I was behind the prototype typing prompts into a text to speech program to communicate with the passengers. I 'activated' features such as aroma therapy, ambiance lighting, and game mode by turning them on from the outside. All the while the admin team observed the subjects from a seperate room through a live stream.</p>
							<p>From analyzing the behaviors of the participants we learned a lot about our design solutions. The findings we discovered went into the final deliverable to Hyundai. </p>

					<div class="contentTextDiv">
						<p >At the forefront of innovation there exists the challenege of not knowing what to do next. Normally inventors improve an existing product or a competitor's product, but what we were developing was a novel product. We had no real reference to turn to. At first this challenge haunted my sleep. I was going through the motions, but were they the right ones? It wasn't until I realized that my entire team and Hyundai did not quite know how to proceed. Personally, this project helped me become  confident in my ability to execute the UX process. Through out the project I still had doubt, but it was differnt. It was healthy an kept me on my toes!</p>
						<p> I also learned that the UX approach to problem solving teaches a very static and unrealistic methodolgy. Real life is unpredictable! No project's process is exactly a double diamond, nor should it be. I conducted field research after we began prototyping because we needed more data. If we had followed the UX proccess percisely, we never would have gotten anywhere. Being adaptable and flexible is a core characteristic of designing great projects. if you've made it this far, thank you for your time. If you would like learn more don't hesitate to ask. </p>
