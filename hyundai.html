				<div class="sectionContent">
					<h5 class="subHeader">Lack of data</h5>
					<div class="subCategory">
						<p>A challenge our team faced was an absence of data on human behavior inside autonomous vehicles, as there are no autonomous vehicles in the public sphere. This data would have been essential to understanding how users interact within a fully autonomous vehicle. Acquiring data from manual operated cars was futile because of the disparity between the experience of manual and autonomous vehicles. In manual cars drivers minimize their trip time by controlling their velocity and route making the experience interactive. However, in autonomous vehicles drivers will lose control over these factors, making the  experience a waiting one.</p>
						<p>To overcome this obstacle I proposed to shift our focus from autonomous vehicles to autonomous spaces. I defined autonomous spaces to be any space that is used to propel the user forward in time to a destination without direct input. This shift of focus allowed us to observe people in common waiting spaces such as busses, trains, and waiting rooms. Because an autonomous vehicle is an autonomous space,  behavior in such autonomous spaces are analogous to the behavior expected to be exhibited in autonomous vehicles. By shifting our focus to be autonmous spaces we were able to obtain data on what people would do inside of of an autonomous vehicle.</p>

					<h4 class="subHeader">Defining the Problem</h4>
						<div class="subCategory">
							<p>Don Norman led the admin team’s first meeting to define the project’s objectives, projection, approach, and timeline. To succeed, we decided to prioritize leveraging UCSD’s unique commuter culture for research to understand user needs and identify pain points. Norman also facilitated ideation leading us to identify topics and concerns to research for the entirety of the project. </p>
							<p>I led a similar meeting with the undergraduate team to introduce them to the project. I explained the project’s objectives as defined by the admin team, followed by an ideation session. The objective of the ideation session was to allow students to explore the problem space while adding to our list of topics to research.</p>
							<p>To begin, the team took two minutes to independently write their ideas or concerns onto post-its. I then divided the undergraduate team into small groups of six and facilitated discussion based on their post-its. To conclude, we reconvened as a team to compile our key thoughts and concerns. We then grouped them by emerging relation to create an affinity diagram.</p>
							<div class="centerImage centerImage">
								<img id="IdeationSession" alt="Ideation in Session" src="images/IdeationSession.jpg" >
								<figcaption> Ideation in session.</figcaption>
							</div>

							<p>From my ideation session with the students we identified several topics the admin team had not considered. For example, women’s safety in automated taxis had major potential, since Hyundai was already interested in developing such a service. Furthermore, we realized that communication would play a pivotal role in the development of A.V.s, as how users communication with the vehicle and other users will influence the trip experience.</p>

						<h4 class="subHeader">Research</h4>
						<div class="subCategory">
							<p> After exploring our problem space through ideation, we began researching. I delegated topics to undergraduates and conducted research of my own. We aimed to discover existing solutions, user needs, and influencing factors of all the topics we had generated through ideation.</p>
							<p>Our team also conducted field research and interviews to understand how users interact with current mobility solutions. I mapped UCSD’s campus and stationed students at high traffic areas during peak hours. Each student recorded modes of transport, items carried, and activities they witnessed. The objective of field research was to develop a deeper understanding of how individuals plan, execute, and manage journeys through transportation. The student team also conducted in-transit observations during their trips back home for winter break. In total we completed 96 hours of field research and 54 in-person interviews.</p>

							<p>When the team finished researching I analyzed the data with my partners Christine Tran and Jodi Lam. Researching specific issues gave us information on what was being done, what had been done, and what could be done to resolve an issue. Field observations provided insight into how people are currently managing and using current modes of transportation. After hours of grouping, sorting, and annotating this information we developed key insights into our problem space. We felt confident that our team knew enough to move forward.</p>

							<p> The admin team worked to synthesize the data into definitive design claims that would be used during the developmental stages of the project. Christine, Jodi, and I led the undergraduate team through synthesizing the data into comprehensible mediums. With the aggregated data I helped the students create user personas, action models, and journey matrices to illustrate our findings.</p>

						<h4 class="subHeader">Brainstorming</h4>
						<div class="subCategory">
							<p> After sharing our findings with the entire team Christine and I led the student team through two brainstorm sessions. The two of us facilitated discussions, ensuring that the undergraduates based their work on the team’s claims and findings.</p>
							<p> From these sessions we began designing solutions for the boarding process, vehicle cleaning, passenger safety, communication, interface control, and much more. As per Hyundai's request we also created fun, novel activities passengers could do inside the A.V.</p>

						<div class="subCategory">
							<p> During brainstorming the admin team realized that we had limited data on what people actually do inside of autonomous vehicles. Accessing this data was difficult because autonomous vehicles did not yet exist in the public sphere. We almost forfeited this data until I proposed an alternate perspective to what we needed.</p>
							<p>I began to consider how in autonomous vehicles, we will lose autonomy over our velocity and route. This will revolutionize the experience of travel to be one of waiting. With no control over the vehicle, self-driving cars will simply be waiting rooms on wheels. As such, I proposed to shift our focus from autonomous vehicles to autonomous spaces. I defined autonomous spaces to be any space that is used to propel the user forward to a destination without direct input. This shift of focus allowed us to observe people in common waiting spaces such as busses, trains, and waiting rooms. Because an autonomous vehicle is an autonomous space,  behavior in autonomous spaces are analogous to the behavior expected to be exhibited in autonomous vehicles. We finally had a means of collecting the data we needed.</p>
							<p>That weekend Jodi Lam and I conducted field observations on the LA metro system, collecting over 18 hours’ worth of footage. When we returned we coded our footage, creating an in-depth analysis of human behavior in autonomous spaces and pinpointing user needs.</p>

						<h4 class="subHeader">Prototyping</h4>
						<div class="subCategory">
							<p>After the students brainstormed, the admin team inspected their work to choose what we should prototype. Don Norman and Colleen Emmenegger guided the admin team through the selection process, emphasizing on choosing ideas that were validated by data. Because this was a preliminary project with Hyundai, we only had enough resources to produce one prototype - so we tried to include as many potential solutions as possible in that prototype. Together, we finalized a plan to develop a prototype that could test the boarding process, various types of user-to-user interactions(friends, strangers, acquaintances), user-vehicle trust, and in-transit activities.</p>
							<div class="centerImage" >
								<img id="AdrianBrandon"  alt="Prototyping in action" src="images/PrototypeCreation.jpg">
							</div>
							<p>I led the construction of the prototype. Our plan was to create a 8ft by 6ft by 6ft wooden frame with added amenities to simulate an autonomous vehicle. With the help of my undergraduate team we constructed the frame and covered it with cloth.</p>
							<p>For the interface, I directed 6 undergraduates through the process of making wireframes using Figma. Once they completed their components, Jodi and I synchronized the wireframes to create a fully simulated car interface. We also created a mobile wireframe interface for users to order an autonomous taxi.</p>
							<div class="centerImage">

							</div>
							<p>To create an immersive, believable experience,we took?a Wizard of Oz approach. I hid on the outside of the box controlling lights, entertainment, and the HUD. To interact with the passengers I acted as the car’s A.I. by using a text-to-talk application. Users would ask to activate certain features, and I would respond via the text-to-talk application before fulfilling their requests. </p>

						<p>The final product was a framework describing critical interdependent factors that affect the autonomous vehicle experience. By using our framework Hyundai will be capable of understanding how users engage with autonomous transit. More importantly they will be ahead of their competition. Due to the non disclosure agreement I signed I am unable to share the critical factors, but am able to describe the process that led us to them. </p>

				<h2 class="projectsHeader"> Reflection</h2>
					<div class="subCategory">
						<p >At the forefront of innovation there exists the challenege of not knowing what to do next. Normally inventors improve an existing product or a competitor's product, but what we were developing was a novel product. We had no real reference to turn to. At first this challenge haunted my sleep. I was going through the motions, but were they the right ones? It wasn't until I realized that my entire team and Hyundai did not quite know how to proceed. Personally, this project helped me become  confident in my ability to execute the UX process. Through out the project I still had doubt, but it was differnt. It was healthy an kept me on my toes!</p>
						<p> I also learned that the UX approach to problem solving teaches a very static and unrealistic methodolgy. Real life is unpredictable! No project's process is exactly a double diamond, nor should it be. I conducted field research after we began prototyping because we needed more data. If we had followed the UX proccess percisely, we never would have gotten anywhere. Being adaptable and flexible is a core characteristic of designing great projects. if you've made it this far, thank you for your time. If you would like learn more don't hesitate to ask. </p>
